# Fonts Lost on GitHub

This repository aims to be a curated list of fonts that were once available on GitHub (either as part of projects or standalone repositories) but are no longer easily discoverable or actively maintained there.

**Why this list?**

Sometimes, great fonts get lost in the shuffle of the ever-evolving open-source landscape. This repository serves as a historical archive and a potential starting point for designers and developers looking for specific or unique typefaces that might have disappeared from the main GitHub search.

**What you'll find here:**

* **List of Lost Fonts:** A markdown table detailing the font name (if known), the last known GitHub repository (if available), and any notes about its disappearance or potential alternative locations.
* **Potential Links:** If we can find alternative download links or information about the font elsewhere, we'll include them.
* **Community Contributions:** We encourage the community to contribute information about other lost fonts!
