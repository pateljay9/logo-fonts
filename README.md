## Font Listings

### Web Fonts

* **Open Sans:** A humanist sans serif typeface designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral-yet-friendly appearance. Highly legible on screen.
* **Roboto:** A neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family. The font has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.
* **Lato:** A sans serif typeface family designed to be serious but friendly, with a feeling of warmth. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.

### Print Fonts

* **Merriweather:** A serif typeface designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes. It has a large x-height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.
* **Playfair Display:** A transitional design. Variations in stroke, and a relatively high contrast of thick and thin strokes, give it distinction. As the name suggests, it is well suited for titles and more stylish text.
* **Garamond:** A group of old-style serif typefaces. Garamond is generally considered one of the most elegant and readable serif typefaces.

### Monospace Fonts (for Code)

* **Fira Code:** An extension of the Fira Mono font containing a large number of ligatures for commonly used programming multi-character symbols.
* **Source Code Pro:** A monospaced typeface family created by Adobe for user interface and coding environments.
* **Consolas:** A monospaced font designed for use with Microsoft Windows. It is part of the ClearType Font Collection and is known for its good readability.
